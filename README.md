# Internal QA Toolbelt

Created based in some capacity as replacement of my previous CLI script for the same purpose. It appears that Manual QA engineers are not too keen on using CLI tools.
Left the functional part out of equation. Only basic **Streamlit** frontend is present.

This repo will eventually also be replaced wth generic version, when I will get to it.
